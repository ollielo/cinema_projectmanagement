# FY18 Q4 Cinema release requirements

As part of our regular release schedule, we are planning a major release of
Cinema capability in September 2018. The drivers for this are:

* Updates in the next major release of ParaView (5.6)
    * ParaView 5.6 will include a major redesign of the Cinema and Catalyst
      export workflow. The UI and workflow will be significantly redesigned
      to simplify export.

* Consolidation of Cinema Specifications
    * We currently have three active database specifications. This has helped
      in rapid exploration of Cinema as it developed, but this now presents
      both a barrier to adoption, and a prohibitive development cost. 
        * With this release, there will be one 'current' version of the 
          Cinema specification, and that will be backwards compatible with 
          previous specifications.
    * We will standardize on a new specification (Eastwood), that supports 
      Spec A, C and D.
        * For the purposes of this document, we are calling the new
          specification Spec E. However, if the update can be accomplished by
          updating Spec D with appendices, that is sufficient, and we need
          not move to Spec E.

## Requirements

* Spec E shall be backwards compatible with A, C and D
* ParaView and VisIt shall export this new specification, and deprecate other
  specifications
* Viewers
    * Cinema: Explorer shall be updated to read Spec E
    * Cinema: Viewer (new) shall replace the current python-based viewer 
      created by Kitware for Spec A and C
        * old Python viewer shall be depricated
* cinema command line tool shall be expanded to include:
    * Spec E verification
    * Spec A to E conversion
    * Spec C to E conversion
    * Other updates to support Spec E
* Cinema workflows to be supported:
    * ParaView shall be able to load and properly support features for all
      Cinema databases it exports.

## Deliverables
* Updated ParaView
* Updated VisIt
* Updated Cinema:Explorer
* New Cinema:Viewer
* Updated cinema command line tool

    * includes user guide, documentation and examples
